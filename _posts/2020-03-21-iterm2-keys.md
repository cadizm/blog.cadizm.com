It can be challenging acclimating oneself to a new computer, especially when
muscle memory key bindings that weren't backed up need to be remapped :(

Hints to my future self:


| Key Combination | Action                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| ⌘b              | `Send ^[b`                |
| ⌘d              | `Send ^[d`                |
| ⌘f              | `Send ^[f`                |
| ⌘←Delete        | `Send Hex Codes: 0x1b 0x8`|


Bonus: Wheat color hex code: `#f5deb3`
