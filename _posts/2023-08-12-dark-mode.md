title: "Dark mode!!!"

I've finally added [support](https://github.com/cadizm/blog.cadizm.com/pull/6) for dark mode ðŸ˜Ž
This has been on my TODO list for a while, especially since adding dark mode support on both
[cadizm.com](https://cadizm.com) and [dev.cadizm.com](https://dev.cadizm.com).

Both of those sites were previously migrated to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which made the job
[much](https://github.com/cadizm/cadizm.github.io/pull/2) [easier](https://github.com/cadizm/dev-frontend/pull/1).

This blog is still using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and tbh it's working just fine since. My needs
are quite simple with my main requirements being:

  1. Uncluttered repo that is easy to understand
  2. Simple and fast static site generation
  3. Support for writing posts/code in Markdown
  4. Ability to typeset mathematics using LaTeX
  5. Support for dark mode!

After adding [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), the only thing that was missing was dark mode.
But no more! Now that most modern browsers have `prefers-color-scheme` media query support, adding
dark mode to this site was much easier than expected!

Because my frontend skills can be described (nicely) as _lacking_, I was googling (and asking ChatGPT)
all sorts of questions about how to migrate Jekyll sites and very old Bootstrap sites to use dark mode.
Most of the answers involved upgrading to the latest [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) which was
something I was not particularly interested in doing.

After initially trying those routes and being unhappy with the results, I went for the manual approach
which ended up being much nicer~ The [PR](https://github.com/cadizm/blog.cadizm.com/pull/6) only needed
the addition of a few media queries for `body`, `anchor`, and `code` elements. As well as choosing more
appropriate syntax highlighting scheme css classes. I learned how easy this is to do using [rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge)

```shell
$ rougify style molokai | pbcopy
```
