Though I've been using `gitk` for years, I've never really found a use for
`git gui`.

One cool `git gui` command I've recently found useful is `git gui blame`.
With it when you right-click a line you get a few options, two of which
are particularly handy: "Show History Context" and "Blame Parent Commit".

Blame Parent Commit is especially practical in that you can recursively
blame each successive revision.
