TIL [ISO 31-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_31-11) exists. Came across
the wiki page when googling the notations for open and closed intervals
(which I can never seem to remember).

As a further reminder:

```
[a, b]
```

denotes the _closed interval_ (closed to adding endpoints) which includes
endpoints `a` and `b`.

```
(a, b)
```

denotes the _oepn interval_ (open to adding endpoints) which excludes
endpoints `a` and `b`.
