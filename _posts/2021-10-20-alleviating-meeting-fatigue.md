Things I try to keep in mind regarding meetings:

* 5 min [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cindy_solomon_5_tips_for_dealing_with_meeting_overload?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) on how to deal with meeting overload
* [HBR flow chart](https://hbr.org/2015/03/do-you-really-need-to-hold-that-meeting) advising whether I _reallyyyy_ need to schedule that meeting
* End meeting with agreement on [Who will do What by When](https://hbr.org/2015/11/two-things-to-do-after-every-meeting)
