I came across [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) today on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9297316)
and am trying it out. This is the first trial post set up to use their
[continuous deployment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous_deployment)
feature. I'll do a more thorough follow-up post once I have some time to
read through their docs a bit more.
